# genes-and-geo

This is a project on the topic of population genetics. 

I investigate the connections between an individual's genotype data and the geography they come from. I conduct an exploratory data analysis of a VCF file. I downsample and perform ld-pruning before running PCA on the genotype data. 

TODO: Add more details documenting the process and how to run the notebook.
